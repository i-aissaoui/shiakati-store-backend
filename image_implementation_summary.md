# Product Image URL Implementation

## Overview
This document summarizes the implementation of image URL support for products in the Shiakati Store POS application. The goal is to store product images when creating products, without displaying them in the desktop application. These images will be used later for the website.

## Implementation Steps Completed

### 1. Database Schema Updates
- Added `image_url` column (TEXT type) to the `products` table
- Added `additional_images` column (TEXT type) to the `products` table
- Created an Alembic migration script (`add_product_images.py`)
- Applied the migration to the PostgreSQL database

### 2. Schema Updates
- Updated `ProductBase` schema to include optional image fields:
  ```python
  image_url: Optional[str] = Field(None, description="URL to the main product image")
  additional_images: Optional[str] = Field(None, description="JSON string with additional product image URLs")
  ```
- Updated `ProductOut` schema to include these fields in API responses

### 3. Desktop Application UI Updates
- Added image URL input fields to the "Add Product" dialog:
  ```python
  image_url_input = QLineEdit()
  image_url_input.setPlaceholderText("Main image URL (optional)")
        
  additional_images_input = QLineEdit()
  additional_images_input.setPlaceholderText("Additional image URLs, comma separated (optional)")
  ```
- Added image URL input fields to the "Edit Product" dialog
- Updated layout to include these fields in both dialogs

### 4. Product Creation/Editing Logic Updates
- Modified `show_add_product_dialog` method to get image URLs from input fields
- Updated product creation logic to include image URLs in the API request:
  ```python
  new_item = {
      "name": name,
      "category_id": category_id,
      "image_url": image_url if image_url else None,
      "additional_images": additional_images if additional_images else None
  }
  ```
- Updated "Quick-Add" product function to support image URLs (with default null values)
- Modified `edit_inventory_item` method to handle image URL updates:
  ```python
  product_update = {
      "image_url": image_url_input.text().strip() or None,
      "additional_images": additional_images_input.text().strip() or None
  }
  ```

### 5. Testing
- Created test scripts to verify image URL storage functionality
- Verified database schema updates using PostgreSQL commands
- Tested API endpoints to ensure image URLs are properly stored and retrieved
- Reset admin password to "123" to facilitate testing

## Result
The implementation is now complete. The POS application can now store image URLs for products during creation and editing, without displaying them in the desktop interface. These URLs will be available for use by the website.

## Future Enhancements
- Add image preview functionality (optional)
- Implement local image upload and storage
- Add bulk image URL import functionality
