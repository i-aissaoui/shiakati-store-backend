"""
Additional improvements for variant_product_dialog.py to prevent persistent popups

1. Enhanced logging and debugging:
   - Add DEBUG flag that can be enabled to show more detailed log messages
   - Include timing information in logs to track dialog lifespans

2. Additional improvements to delayed_image_refresh:
   - Track all created dialogs in a class-level list for direct reference
   - Add more extensive pre-checks specifically for products like P7111001
   - Centralize timer management to prevent orphaned timers

3. Enhancements to ensure_loading_dialogs_closed:
   - Add ability to target cleanup by product code for more specific cleanup
   - Implement a staged approach that tries gentler methods first
   - Create a background worker thread option for particularly stubborn dialogs

4. UI/UX improvements to prevent user confusion:
   - Add loading indicator in status bar instead of dialog for small operations
   - Add clear messaging when a product has no images instead of just empty space
   - Include option to disable image loading for slow connections

5. Further dialog management:
   - Use a modal-less progress indicator instead of message box for longer operations
   - Implement a central dialog manager that tracks all open dialogs
   - Add timeout parameter to all dialogs to ensure they close after a period
