## Files Cleaned
The following key files were cleaned of debugging statements:

### Desktop Application
1. `/desktop_app/main.py` - Removed initialization debug prints
2. `/desktop_app/src/ui/main_window_new/pos_page.py` - Cleaned receipt generation debug logging

## Cleanup Tools Created
Several tools were created to facilitate the cleanup process:
- `cleanup2.py` - Initial cleanup script
- `final_cleanup.py` - Enhanced cleanup for more complex debug statements
- `verify_cleanup.py` - Verification tool to ensure all debug statements were removed

## Outcome
The application now runs with a clean console output, making it more professional and deployment-ready. All necessary functionality was preserved while removing the development-time debugging statements.
